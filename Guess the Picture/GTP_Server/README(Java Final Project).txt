Thank you for playing GUESS THE WORD! (our version of skribblio)

There are two runnable java files: GTP_Server.java and GTP_Client.java.

In our version of the game, 5 chosen pictures will be shown on screen, and the players will have to guess what the pictures are. They have 10 seconds to guess each picture.

Players will need to input the server IP address and username and press the ENTER key. Then, start communicating with the program and the other players through the chat.

Here are a few important things for this game: 
- The default port to join the server is: 800. 
- The game does not detect unique usernames.
- The game will only start when all players who have entered the game enters 'start' (regardless of Upper or Lower case) to start the game from their terminals.
- When a player outputs the correct answer, the answer will not be displayed on screen.
- After the 5 pictures have been shown and a winner is announced, the threads in the GTP_server.java is programmed to stop. So, please stop running GTP_server.java and restart.
- The correct guesses for the pictures are: cat, dog, rabbit, lion and java. 


The pictures used in the game are from:
